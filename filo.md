# Imp of the project with health and cleanliness
## Health and cleanliness of the surroundings
* Rotten fruits and vegetables create a lot of foul smell and allow microbes to culture and cause allergies and other health problems
<br> Our machine seprates them before getting rotten 
* Many times the hawkers sell rotten fruits along with good ones that create serious health problems like food poisoning 
* Fruit sellers suffer a lot of loss as one rotten fruits spoils many other fresh fruits

## Solution 
To solve this problem a RFS(rotten fruit separator) gadget is needed. An efficient manner to sort the maximum range of fruit with minimum time a color sensor tcs3200 is used. 
We have created a funnel shape modal set up with arduino uno,  a color sensor, 2 servo motor(sr1, sr2). When sensor will sense green color than sr1 will stop other balls and sr2 will turn 90° which make the ball to fall in second box, when sensor will sense red color than sr1 will do the equal and sr2 will turn 180° which make the ball to fall in 1st container
